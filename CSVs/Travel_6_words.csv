Budget.Why
should
I
book
a
car
rental
in
the
United
States
with
Booking.com?We
make
it
easy
to
find
a
rental
that’ll
fit
your
needs.
Here’s
what
we
offer:
Huge
selection
of
cars
–
from
compact
vehicles
to
SUVs
Support
in
30+
languages
Free
cancellation
up
to
48
hours
before
pick-up
time
on
most
bookings.What
do
I
need
to
rent
a
car?When
you’re
booking
a
"car,"
all
you
need
is
a
debit
or
credit
card.
At
the
rental
"counter,"
you’ll
need:
Your
passport
Your
voucher
A
driver’s
license
for
each
driver
The
main
driver’s
credit
card
(some
companies
accept
debit
"cards,"
but
most
don’t).
Important:
Check
the
car’s
rental
terms
as
"well,"
because
each
company
has
its
own
rules.
For
"example,"
they
might
need
to
see
extra
"ID,"
might
not
accept
certain
types
of
credit
"cards,"
or
might
not
rent
to
anybody
who
hasn’t
held
their
driver's
license
for
36
"months,"
etc.Am
I
old
enough
to
rent
a
car?Most
companies
will
let
you
rent
a
car
if
you’re
at
least
"21,"
and
some
will
even
rent
to
younger
drivers.
"However,"
if
you’re
under
"25,"
you
might
have
to
pay
a
"""young"
driver
"fee.""Can"
I
book
a
rental
car
for
someone
else?Of
course.
Just
put
their
info
on
the
"""Driver"
"details"""
form
when
booking
the
car.Any
tips
for
picking
the
right
car?
Think
about
where
you’re
going.
An
SUV
might
be
great
for
cruising
down
a
Texas
"freeway,"
but
a
smaller
car
will
be
a
lot
easier
for
getting
around
Rome.
See
what
other
people
think.
You’ll
find
lots
of
reviews
and
ratings
on
our
"site,"
so
check
out
what
other
customers
liked
(and
didn’t
like)
about
each
company.
Don’t
forget
the
transmission.
In
some
"countries,"
almost
everyone
drives
manual
"cars,"
while
automatics
are
the
norm
in
other
ones.
Make
sure
you
rent
a
car
you
can
drive!
Are
all
fees
included
in
the
rental
price?The
price
you
see
includes
the
"car,"
mandatory
coverage
(e.g.
Theft
"Protection,"
Collision
Damage
"Waiver),"
and
fees
"that,"
if
they
"apply,"
are
usually
payable
at
pick-up
(e.g.
any
one-way
"fees,"
airport
"surcharges,"
or
local
taxes).
It
also
includes
any
extras
you
already
added
(e.g.
"GPS,"
baby
seats).
It
doesn’t
include
any
extra
coverage
you
buy
when
you
get
to
the
rental
counter.
